# Advanced Morphology Project 2022

TEEEEST

_:warning: This repository is a work in progress._

The goal of this project is to study fasttext word embeddings with and without sub-word information.

We will be comparing pairs of words and trying to see how well their edit-distance correlates with the cosine similarity of their vector representations (with or without subword information).
