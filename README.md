# Advanced Morphology Project 2022

_:warning: This repository is a work in progress._

The goal of this project is to study fasttext word embeddings with and without sub-word information.

We are looking for the extent to which subword information is boosting the correlation between form similarity and vector similarity.
For this, we compare pairs of words and try to see how well their edit-distance correlates with the cosine similarity of their vector representations (with or without subword information).
